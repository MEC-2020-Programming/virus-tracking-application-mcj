## Coronavirus Tracking Tool Application

- Achieve the 5th place in 2020 McMaster Engineering Competition (8 hours programming Competition)
- Developed a Java Interface with functions of searching & ranking countries by the number of Total Cases, New Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases.
- Designed a multifunctional world map showing the number of total cases, new cases, total deaths, total recovered, active cases of the countries by different color and sizes of circle in python.

## Problem Statement

The recent coronavirus outbreak has affected a huge portion of the population, being a 
global health threat that called for the attention of the World Health Organization to address 
it as a “public health emergency of international concern.” The virus attacked multiple 
unexpecting regions and the number of people affected rapidly grew at an exponential rate. 

As an engineer, we are well-equipped to take on the task of building an application that can 
potentially save lives in unexpecting future epidemics by spotting possible outbreaks and 
alerting those in increasingly affected areas to take precautions.
